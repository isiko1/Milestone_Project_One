Brexit - An Unfortunate Journey

Although some may say Brexit is an opportunity rather than an unfortunate circumstance. This project gives an insight on the political journey that arrives at United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union and the birth of the ubiquitous term we've come to know as Brexit. 
The events surrounding Brexit are vast and constantly changing, so much so that theres scope to add more to the project and transforming it into a live progressive one. There is in the project an opportunity for the user to share their thoughts and opinion with other users. 

UX

The project is an informative one for the academic or those who wish to explore Brexit o even public interest. The topic is simple to follow chronoligally
and can be understood by the average man/woman on the street. I have decided to make my project about Brexit and it's unfortunate journey to completion, if at all that goal is attainable. 
Originally, in the project i had intended a timeline from the first referendum to join the EU in the 1970s taking you on a journey to the present state of affairs. Unfortunately, due to the size of the content i limited it from  the paasing of the Referendum Law passed by the Queen.

Acknowlegements

I was inspired by The Rosie mini-project for the lay out and structure which combined, has allowed me to utilise some of the coding and manipulate it to reach my desired outcome. Further inspiration has come from the CSS transitions modules of the course.
