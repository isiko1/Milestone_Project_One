Hi there! 

Welcome to my first Milestone project.

I have decided to make my project about Brexit and it's unfortunate journey to completion, if at all that goal is attainable.
Acknowlegements go out to The Rosie mini-project for the lay out and structure which combined, has allowed me to utilise from the project some of the coding and manipulate it to reach my desired outcome. Furtehre inspiration has come from the CSS transitions modules of the course.
I would also like to acknolwedge Channel 4 News, BBC, Politico EU and YouTube from which I have obtained infromation whilst researching and keepin abreast of the topic.
The project has timeline from the first referendum to join the EU in the 1970s taking you on a journey to the present state of affairs.

I hope you enjoy it.
