## Brexit - An Unfortunate Journey

Although some may say Brexit is an opportunity rather than an unfortunate circumstance. This project gives an insight on the political journey that arrives at United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union and the birth of the ubiquitous term we've come to know as Brexit. 
The events surrounding Brexit are vast and constantly changing, so much so that theres scope to add more to the project and transforming it into a live progressive one. There is in the project an opportunity for the user to share their thoughts and opinion with other users. 

## UX

The project is an informative one for the academic or those who wish to explore Brexit o even public interest. The topic is simple to follow chronoligally
and can be understood by the average man/woman on the street. I have decided to make my project about Brexit and it's unfortunate journey to completion, if at all that goal is attainable. 
Originally, in the project i had intended a timeline from the first referendum to join the EU in the 1970s taking you on a journey to the present state of affairs. Unfortunately, due to the size of the content i limited it from  the paasing of the Referendum Law passed by the Queen.

## Features

The home page

Displays the European Union Flag and details the different institutions of the EU. The display of the home page depicts a united  EU and its components. The contents of the page depicts the start of the journey.

Overview Page

Displays the British flag emerging from the EU as the timeline to Brexit ticks away to enventually arrive at the Referendum results.

The Vision Page

Displays the British flag and depicts a Britain outside the EU inviting the user for their thoughts and vision of a Britain outside of the EU.


Download

The user has the option to download a summary of Article 50 to gain a better understanding of exiting the EU              

## Features left to Implement

There are a multitude of features that can be applied such as links to forums, interactive simulations of before and after scenarios. Live chat video links. Live update feeds, subscriptions and memembership links to pro and against groups. Links to further reading or reasearch

## Technologies used

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Fontawesome

## Testing

Background colour testing had to be carried to give the right effect. The flags were changed frequently to arrive at the required theme hence the variety of images saved.
On right clicking and selecting inspect, one can choose the various platform views i.e iphone 6, Ipad or Desktop etc.

Testing was carried out to locate the project in Git hub and it was realised that the repository had not been created. Please see snippet below:

## Credits

## Content
The object fit css was recommended by my mentor. It has an error display next to the line where it has been used.  Something I will research later to find out the cause but at the moment it has contributed to the visual appearance.
The text and timeline was copied from a bbc article.

## Acknowlegements

I was inspired by The Rosie mini-project for the lay out and structure which combined, has allowed me to utilise some of the coding and manipulate it to reach my desired outcome. Further inspiration has come from the CSS transitions modules of the course.
